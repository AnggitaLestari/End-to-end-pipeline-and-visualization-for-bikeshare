# Bikeshare-Data-ETL-Analysis-Visualization-Pipeline

## Welcome to My Business Intelligence Project Repository!

## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ 

This repository showcases my journey from a coding novice to a budding Business Intelligence and Data Analytics. 

Here, you'll find the code for my Bikeshare Data ETL and Analysis project, 

which I completed during the intensive Business Intelligence Bootcamp at Binar Academy.

## About This Project

This comprehensive project demonstrates my newly acquired skills in:
* Data Engineering with Python and Prefect
* Database Management using PostgreSQL
* SQL Querying
* Cloud Technology (Google BigQuery)
* End-to-End Project Management

**Dataset** The dataset used in this project is the Bikeshare Dataset, which can be downloaded from the following link: 

* [Bikeshare Dataset (RAR file)](https://bikesharedataset.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/Bikeshare_Dataset/Bikeshare_Dataset.rar) 

Please note that you will need to extract the RAR file to access the dataset.


## Project Overview

This project involves processing and analyzing bikeshare data using various tools and technologies. The main steps of the project are:

1. Data Extraction and Loading
2. Data Transformation
3. Data Analysis
4. Visualization

Let's go through each step in detail:

### 1. Data Extraction and Loading

The project starts by extracting data from CSV files and loading it into a PostgreSQL database. This process is managed using Python and the Prefect workflow management tool.

The ETL process is implemented using Python and the Prefect library. The `create_db_engine()` and `load_csv_to_postgresql()` functions are responsible for connecting to the PostgreSQL database and loading the CSV data into it.

### 2. Data Transformation

After loading the data into PostgreSQL, several transformation steps are performed:
* Processing regions data
* Cleaning and transforming station information
* Processing trip data and creating fact and dimension tables

These transformations are implemented in the `process_regions()`, `process_station_info()`, and `process_trips()` functions.

### 3. Data Analysis

The project includes several SQL queries to analyze the transformed data. These queries cover various aspects of the bikeshare system, such as:
* Total trips by region and year
* Average trip duration by region, year, and member type
* Most popular travel routes
* Station utilization analysis
* Age group and gender distribution of trips

The queries are executed using the `execute_query()` function and the results are stored for further processing.

### 4. Visualization

The final step involves uploading the analyzed data to Google BigQuery for visualization. The `upload_to_bigquery()` function handles this process.

This diagram shows the main tasks in the Prefect flow, including data loading, verification, processing, and uploading to BigQuery.

The final result of this project is a comprehensive dashboard visualizing various aspects of the bikeshare system:

This dashboard provides insights into various aspects of the bikeshare system, including:
* Total trips by region
* Regional bikeshare trends
* Top 10 most popular travel routes
* Trip duration by region and member type
* Bicycle station utilization per region
* Age group trip distribution
* Busiest days and hours per region
